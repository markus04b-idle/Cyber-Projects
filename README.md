This project evaluates cybersecurity risks using asset value, threat likelihood,
and impact severity. It calculates a risk score and suggests mitigation actions
based on the result.

## Risk Formula
Risk = Asset Value × Likelihood × Impact

## Risk Levels
- Low: 1–20
- Medium: 21–50
- High: 51+

## Technologies Used
- Python 3

## Example Output
Risk Score: 60  
Risk Level: HIGH  
Recommended Action: Immediate mitigation required.
